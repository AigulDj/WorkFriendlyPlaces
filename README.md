# WorkFriendlyPlaces
Website that lists cafes with wifi, power etc for remote working.

Just a simple website where users can find a place to work, searching by certain criteria like availability of wifi, sockets etc. 
In addition, users themselves can also add places to be stored in the database.

Unfortunately, I couldn't find a free version of google map API to make the map more useful, thus it is just a useless map there, 
but you can click on the place's name, which is a link to its Google map info.
