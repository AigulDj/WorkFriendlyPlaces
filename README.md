# WorkFriendlyPlaces

WorkFriendlyPlaces is a simple website that enables remote workers to find cafes and other venues with wifi and power. Users can search for a location based on specific criteria, such as availability of wifi and sockets. Additionally, users can contribute to the database by adding new places to the list.

Although a map is displayed on the website, I was unable to integrate the Google Maps API due to the cost. However, users can still access Google Maps by clicking on the name of the place they are interested in.
